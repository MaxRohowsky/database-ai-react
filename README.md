## 💡 What's This All About?

I'm building an **AI-first database client**. In non-nerdy language: a desktop app that lets you *search and edit your DB by chatting with it*.

## ❓ Why make this?

I'm not happy with the currently available clients - especially PG admin which (despite it's flaws) is currently my weapon of choice.

## 💣 What I want to make:

Here's what I want:
- I want the query syntax to match the database engine that I use without having to learn favours of SQL across ~20 DB engines.
- I want the SQL queries to be tailored to my DB tables by sending the DB Schema as context.
- A beautiful desktop native app that saves all my env vars on my Computer not some random cloud.
- Supports all the relational database technologies that i use on the regular in one unified client app. 

## 🚀 Try It Out

* **Download v0.0.2**: [maxrohowsky.com/database-chat](https://maxrohowsky.com/database-chat)
* **Join the Community**: [discord.gg/JERatQsfY8](https://discord.gg/JERatQsfY8)

P.S. Download website still looks sketchy af. sorry for that :) If it looks too sketchy, then feel free to fork the repo and run the build process.

## 🛠️ Dev Pipeline (WIP)

What's done:
* ✅ Postgres & PG Wrappers (e.g. Supabase) support
* ✅ OpenAI & Anthropic model support
* ✅ Dropdown with an overview of the DB Schema
* ✅ Favorite, rename, remove chat
* ✅ Chat functionality works for the most part

What I'm currently working on:
* 💾 Save sql snippets
* ⚙️ Direct SQL execution
* 🧠 Chat refinement
* 🌲 Schema & table tree
* 📘 Setup guides for connecting your DBs
* 🔌 Support for more LLM providers
* 🎁 One *secret feature* I'm really excited about... 😎
