## 💡 What's This All About?

I'm building an **AI-first database client**. In non-nerdy language: a desktop app that lets you *search and edit your DB by chatting with it*.

## ❓ Why make this?

I'm not happy with the currently available clients - especially PG admin which (despite it's flaws) is currently my weapon of choice.

## 💣 What I want to make:

Here's what's on my wishlist:
- I want the query syntax to match the database engine without having to learn favours of SQL across ~20 DB engines.
- I want SQL queries to match my DB tables by sending the DB Schema to the AI as context.
- I want a beautiful desktop native app that saves all my sensitive information on my computer - not some random cloud.
- I want support for all the relational database technologies in one unified client app.
