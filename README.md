## 💡 What's This All About?

I'm building an **AI-first database client**. In non-nerdy language: a desktop app that lets you *search and edit your DB by chatting with it*.

## ❓ Why make this?

I'm not happy with the currently available clients - especially PG admin which (despite it's flaws) is currently my weapon of choice.

## 💣 What I want to make:

Here's what I want:
- I want the query syntax to match the database engine that I use without having to learn favours of SQL across ~20 DB engines.
- I want the SQL queries to be tailored to my DB tables by sending the DB Schema as context.
- A beautiful desktop native app that saves all my env vars on my Computer not some random ass cloud.
- Supports all the relational database technologies that i use on the regular in one unified client app.  
- A bomb dark mode.
